You should go to prose.io and click the authorize with GitHub link.

### Login to Github

username: **SpaceInvaders13**

password: **invaders2013**

### Back to Prose

You will be presented with two folders when you login as follows

- info - these are the other pages such as the "Useful Info Page"
- features - this are the parts that make up the homepage. HTML only please try not to break anything.

### Editing a Page

Please restrict your editing as much as possible to the pages within the info directory only with the file extension **.md**.

Click on the info folder.

Then you click the file you would like to edit such as 2013-06-22-useful-info.md

### Creating a New Page

__This section is to made user friendly in the coming days so you don't have to remember half of this information__

First enter the folder you wish to create the file aka **info**

You will be presented with an editor screen like before. Enter the filename. Part of this will already be filled for you something like this **info/2013-XX-XX-...**

Enter the file name after the date using dashes (**-**) to seperate words and not spaces.

You will need to enter some metadata which can be accessed by the icon on the right for metadata. Copy and past the following into that text box while also amending the title to that of your choosing.

Enter the content you would like to appear on the page using the markdown syntax which is fairly simple. 

If you are looking for a reference on how to write Markdown look at the following link http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax or else click the **?** in the editor toolbar for a quick reference.

Also if in doubt save the document and look at what is used on other .md files on the site.

Alwasys make sure to commit your changes, click the save button.

All the Best
Colin
