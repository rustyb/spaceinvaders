        <p class="lead">Congratulations to Seamus and Tom√°s of the Crayon Set for winning the first edition of Space Invaders! We also want to congratulate all the teams for entering and producing such great designs. Space Invaders was an amazing experience for us and this could not have been done without the help and support of our sponsors, <strong> Dublin City Council, Royal Town Planning Institute, The Irish Planning Institute, The Digital Hub, Dublin , Diageo, Downey Planning, Masterplan Associates, BMA Planning, McGill Planning and MacCabe Durney Barnes</strong>. We also want to say a massive thank you to <em>Jennie and Wagner of the Luncheonette</em> for preparing such delicious food. Last but no least, thank you to Thomas Street itself and the the community, <strong>Thomas Street Business Asssociation</strong> and the <strong>Fountain Resource Group</strong> for letting us invade your space! </p>
